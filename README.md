# Unexpected Loop Iteration Bug in Java

This repository demonstrates a common, yet easily overlooked, error in Java involving the post-increment operator within a `while` loop condition.  The issue arises from misunderstanding how the post-increment operator (`i++`) affects the loop's termination condition. 

The `Bug.java` file contains the code exhibiting the error. The `BugSolution.java` shows the corrected code, along with explanations.
